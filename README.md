### :information_source: Critique

> Test Details
 - I've created 4 demo users that you can use to test the application : <span style='color:green'>dummyUser, otherDummyUser, someDummyUser and oneDummyUser</span>

 - There is, also, some post already created, so it's possible to test some validation cases

 - I've included in zip file a collection that you can use to try the application

 - All environment variables are included in zip file, but ignored in git

> Possible Improvements

- I've saved only the post Object Id in repostedPost field, it is better for database performance, but for recover the information you need to populate the request, so front-end can display the post correctly, and this populate method goes down only one level of the repost field. It means that if some other user repost a post that is a repost, the repost information will not be displayed correctly. So, if I got more time, I'd implement a custom populate method to recover post information.

- Babel needs to be configure to transpile param decorators. If I got more time, I would configure it and change tsc. Babel if faster and more reliable.

> Scaling up

- I think that the worst part dealing with lots of request is recovering information. Especially when using Object Id as reference to other document. I think that the better solution for this is to change the repostedPost field to store a document, instead of Object Id. It will make the database grows fast, but will reduce the time to get the post information.

- I would also use a cloud service to host this application in a container, like EKS, where it can implement a load balancer and auto-scaling routines.
